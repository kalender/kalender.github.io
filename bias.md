## Statistical and venecular bias

A statistically biased sample is a sample with significant differences from the population from which it is sampled. 
If in the total population women earn 10% less, are outnumbered 2-1 in physics, or are more 50% less involved in violence crime 
than men, samples with corresponding numbers are not biased.
